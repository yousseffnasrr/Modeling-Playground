# 🧠 Modeling Playground

Welcome to **Modeling Playground** — my dedicated space for experimenting with machine learning models, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.  

This repository brings together a toolkit of essential Python libraries and serves as a central hub for exploring, building, and optimizing models.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **NumPy** – Efficient mathematical operations and linear algebra utilities  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis with DataFrames  
- **Matplotlib** – Flexible static and interactive visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – High-level, beautiful statistical plotting  
- **Statsmodels** – Statistical tests, regression modeling, and in-depth data exploration  
- *(Planned)* **SciPy** – Advanced scientific computing & optimization routines  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Train and evaluate **machine learning models**  
- Perform **linear regression** and other statistical techniques  
- Generate **model predictions** and compare results  
- Experiment with **optimization techniques** (future addition)

---

## 📂 Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter or Colab notebooks for experiments  
- `scripts/` – Clean, reusable Python scripts  
- `results/` – Key outputs, visualizations, and model metrics  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add SciPy-powered optimization routines  
- Expand to classification, clustering, and more advanced ML techniques  
- Build reproducible model pipelines

---

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts — this repo will keep growing as I experiment with new techniques and models!
